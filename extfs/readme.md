# extfs: Extended Filesystem handler for Cheviot OS.

Algorithms and macros based on the Minix 3 minix/minix/fs/ext2 sources. 
These have been refactored for Cheviot OS.  Original header comments
have been updated.

Files mentioning MFS in the header are under the Minix license.

Currently supports only ext2 filesystems.
Does not support ext4 extent based block management.

This has not been tested.
